1.Sum without Leaf 
  [You will be given a binary tree as input in level order. You need to 
  output the sum of all node's values in that tree except the leaf nodes.]

2. Leaf nodes
  [You will be given a binary tree as input in level order. You need 
  to print the values of leaf nodes in descending order.]

3. perfect binary tree
  [You will be given a binary tree as input in level order. You need to 
  tell if the binary tree is perfect or not. A binary tree is called 
  perfect if all leaf nodes are at the maximum depth of the tree, 
  and the tree is completely filled with no gaps.]

4. Level Nodes
 [You will be given a binary tree as input in level order. Also you will 
 be given a level 'X'. You need to print all the node's values in that 
 level from left to right. Assume that level starts from 0.
  If the level 'X' is not a valid level, the print "Invalid".]

5. Print Outer Tree
 [You will be given a binary tree as input in level order. You need to 
 print the outer side of the binary tree. See the sample input output for 
 more clarifications. 
 You need to print from the left most leaf node to right most leaf node.
